## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Request-port interface identity survives effective configuration

A `nats-request` port SHALL be decoded and resolved only through the canonical nested `config.kind` envelope. Its
subject, timeout, direction, required state, interface type, and interface version SHALL survive strict JSON decoding,
complete named-port replacement, runtime configuration reads, and normalized flow facts.

No flat field, legacy alias, or builder fallback SHALL restore missing port meaning.

#### Scenario: Mutation request port survives canonical round-trip

- **GIVEN** a canonical graph-mutation `nats-request` declaration
- **WHEN** it is decoded, merged, read through runtime configuration, and projected as normalized port facts
- **THEN** it remains a graph-mutation request port
- **AND** its subject, timeout, direction, required state, interface type, and interface version are unchanged

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Component ports have one strict canonical grammar

Port configuration SHALL contain only `inputs` and `outputs`.

Each port SHALL contain the common fields `name`, `required`, and `description`, plus a nested `config` object
discriminated by exactly one of these kinds: `timer`, `network`, `file`, `http-client`, `nats`, `nats-request`,
`jetstream`, `kv-watch`, `kv-read`, `kv-write`, `store-read`, `store-provide`.

Unknown kinds, unknown fields, kinds used in a prohibited direction, duplicate or unknown named ports, malformed
durations or network ports, and missing required fields SHALL fail before component initialization. The failure SHALL
identify the component, port, kind, and invalid field when those values are available.

Only network host `0.0.0.0` and request timeout `1s` SHALL receive implicit defaults.

Retired flat port fields, `Config any`, runtime `type`/`data` envelopes, legacy aliases, and top-level KV lanes SHALL
NOT be accepted.

#### Scenario: Canonical definition and runtime views agree

- **GIVEN** a valid canonical port declaration
- **WHEN** it is decoded and exposed through runtime configuration
- **THEN** the definition and runtime views preserve identical direction, kind, required state, description, resource
  fields, and interface metadata

#### Scenario: Legacy declaration fails without repair

- **GIVEN** a declaration that uses a retired flat field, legacy alias, runtime `type`/`data` envelope, `Config any`, or
  top-level KV lane
- **WHEN** configuration is decoded
- **THEN** startup fails before component initialization
- **AND** no compatibility repair, alias expansion, or fallback is attempted

#### Scenario: Named merge is complete replacement

- **GIVEN** a valid override naming an existing port
- **WHEN** effective configuration is produced
- **THEN** the override completely replaces that named port
- **AND** omitted kind-specific fields are not inherited from the prior declaration

#### Scenario: Invalid named merge is rejected

- **WHEN** an override names an unknown port, repeats a port name, changes a port's direction, or changes its kind
- **THEN** effective configuration fails with typed component and port context

#### Scenario: JetStream fields survive canonical round-trip

- **GIVEN** a canonical `jetstream` declaration
- **WHEN** it is decoded, merged, exposed through runtime configuration, and projected as normalized facts
- **THEN** its subjects, storage, retention, days, size, replicas, consumer, deliver policy, acknowledgement policy,
  maximum deliveries, acknowledgement wait, heartbeat, maximum pending acknowledgements, and interface metadata are
  unchanged
