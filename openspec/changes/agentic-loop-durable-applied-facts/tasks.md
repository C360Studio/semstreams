## 1. Field and invariant surface

- [ ] 1.0 New `processor/agentic-loop/internal/looprequest`: `Parse(id) (loopID string, iteration, retry int, err)` over `<loopID>:req:<i>:<r>` (loopID may itself contain colons; parse from the right, require all four parts, reject a missing retry part), `Next(prev, retry bool) string` (retry → same iteration, retry+1; else iteration+1, retry 0), `Compare(a, b)` on `(iteration, retry)`. `Next` must reproduce `ST:1345-1347` (`iteration = entity.Iterations + 1`; `%s:req:%d:%d`), so birth mints `…:req:1:0` from `Iterations = 0`. `Parse` becomes the one reader of the grammar, replacing the two prefix-only readers on `main`: `ST:1360-1361` (`ExtractLoopIDFromRequest`) and `LP:50` (`loopIDFromStructuredID`). L2 (PR #1335) shipped no parser because no reader existed yet; this change is the reader. Rapid property: `Parse(format(x)) == x`; `Compare` is a total order consistent with `Next`.
- [ ] 1.1 `agentic/state.go`: add `PublishedRequestID string \`json:"published_request_id,omitempty"\`` beside `AG:57`
      with the I1 doc comment; `Validate` (`AG:136`) unchanged. Test: `agentic/state_test.go` JSON round-trip;
      `TransitionTo` (`AG:171`) keeps it.
- [ ] 1.2 `processor/agentic-loop/state.go`: `SetPublishedRequest(loopID, requestID)`; new `restoreLoopFromRequest`
      beside `attachContinuation` (`ST:298`) — no rebuild path exists on `main` — fed the record step 0 (2.5) already
      adopted plus the newest retained request; it rebuilds the ContextManager, the routing maps (`ST:79`
      `outstandingRequests`, `ST:887-888`) and the tool batch (`restoreToolBatch`, membership against the retained
      response only), so it has no `PublishedRequestID` mismatch to refuse. Test: `state_test.go` — set /
      restore-after-adoption / restore-equal.

## 2. Carrier: order, CAS, identity adoption

- [ ] 2.1 `processor/agentic-loop/component.go`: `persistLoopState` (`C:2468`, write `C:2483`) takes `revision` and uses
      `loopsBucket.Update` (`KV:231`); `persistHandlerResult` (`C:1923`) publishes (`C:1959`) before it writes
      (`C:1947`) for every non-terminal result; birth (`C:1496` publish → `C:1499` `Put` with the error ignored today)
      becomes `Put` → publish, and a birth write that errors returns Retry — the first of #1345's five task-intake
      branches, converted by necessity; the other four stay #1345's. On `ErrKVRevisionMismatch` (`KV:238`) return Retry
      and release the loop's process state (`ST:574`, `C:1964`). `persistLoopState`'s other callers ride the same
      `Update`: `C:1425` (deferred continuation marker) and `AS:101` (sweeper, whose own publish → `Put` pair at
      `AS:100-101` moves onto the carrier). Test: `persist_handler_result_test.go` — publish observed before `Update`;
      CAS conflict → `DeliveryDecisionRetry`; birth order write-then-publish.
- [x] 2.2 `C:2318-2333` `publishResults`: messages on the `agent.request` subject publish via `PublishToStreamWithMsgID`
      with `Nats-Msg-Id = RequestID`. **Shipped by L2 (#1328, PR #1335)** — recorded here because tasks record work when
      it happens. Verified at `b7ce8727`:
      `git grep -n PublishToStreamWithMsgID -- 'processor/agentic-loop/*.go'` →
      `processor/agentic-loop/component.go:2328:		if err := c.natsClient.PublishToStreamWithMsgID(ctx, msg.Subject, msg.Data, msg.MsgID); err != nil {`;
      the three mint sites it carries, `git grep -n 'MsgID:' -- 'processor/agentic-loop/*.go'` →
      `processor/agentic-loop/handlers.go:1174:				MsgID:   request.RequestID,`,
      `processor/agentic-loop/handlers.go:2194:		MsgID:   request.RequestID,`,
      `processor/agentic-loop/handlers.go:2958:		MsgID:   request.RequestID,`.
      Test: `publication_semantics_integration_test.go` (exists). L4a verifies the window collapse only.
- [ ] 2.3 `component.go`: new `readRetainedAgentRequest` (identity only; the newest message on `agent.request.<loopID>`,
      pattern `PS:21`/`PS:28`/`PS:37` `GetLastMsgForSubject`, `TR:51`) behind a new evidence-reader interface with two
      reads (request, response), called before `C:2318` for the messages minted at `H:1122`, `H:2168`, `H:2927`; plus a
      revision-returning entity read (`LP:75` discards `entry.Revision()` today). Adopt on exact `RequestID` match,
      publish on absent/current, quarantine anything else (design § 3.3). Test: unit through the evidence-reader seam —
      retained == next → no publish; == current → publish; absent → publish; other → Quarantine.
- [ ] 2.4 `handlers.go`: set the field at the three minting sites (`H:1122` in `buildTaskRequest`, `H:2168` in
      `emitRetryRequest`, `H:2927` in `publishIterationRequest`); mint via `looprequest.Next(PublishedRequestID)`
      (task 1.0); retry ordinal from the parsed field; delete `IncrementTruncationRetry` (`ST:466`) and
      `ResetTruncationRetry` (`ST:477`) with their callers `H:2037`, `H:1389`, `H:1409` and the map cleared at
      `ST:588`. Test: `handlers_test.go` — grammar holds; retry ordinal survives a rebuilt LoopManager.
- [ ] 2.5 Step 0 for every cold read but the task lane (design § 3.6): read the newest retained request (task 2.3's
      reader), order it against `PublishedRequestID` with `looprequest.Parse`/`Compare` (task 1.0); newer →
      `Update(revision)` the record before classifying — field, `Iterations = parsed iteration − 1` (`ST:1345`: a
      record's request carries `Iterations + 1`), `PendingToolResults = nil` (the shape the advance itself leaves on
      `main`, `H:2870` → `ST:1121`), and `PendingApproval = nil` + `State = running` when a gate was pending; no entry
      is synthesized. Older/unparseable → Fatal → Quarantine. Wire at the cold arms `C:1700`
      (`settleResponseWithoutLoop`) and `C:2292` (`settleToolResultWithoutLoop`); NOT the task lane (Q1) and NOT cancel
      (`C:2593-2612` classifies by `State` only). Test: unit via the evidence-reader seam — equal / newer-adopt (record
      passes `Validate`, `AG:136`; applied set empty; I4 holds) / newer-adopt over an `awaiting_approval` record (gate
      cleared, `State = running`) / older / unparseable.
- [ ] 2.6 Birth by `Create` and CAS-loss release (docket OQ3, owner ruling 2026-09-22): birth writes the record with
      `loopsBucket.Create` (`KV:211`) so a second consumer's birth is refused with `ErrKVKeyExists` (`KV:218`) and
      takes the cold fork; a CAS loss anywhere on the carrier releases the loop's process state (`ST:574` `DeleteLoop`,
      `C:1964` `releaseLoopTransientState`) before it returns Retry. Test: `persist_handler_result_test.go` — a second
      birth for the same loop ID is refused and forks cold; after a CAS loss the loop holds no in-memory state and the
      redelivery reads the winning record.
- [ ] 2.7 Gate order, conditional (docket OQ8, owner ruling 2026-09-22): write the test that an approval answer
      arriving before its gate is durable is Retried by the approval-response lane's cold KV branch. If it can be
      written, the approval gate takes the uniform publish → `Update` order with every other lane (task 2.1). If it
      cannot be written in this change's scope, the accepted write → publish branch for the gate stands, and the PR
      body records which branch shipped and why. Test: `persist_handler_result_test.go` (gate branch) plus the lane
      case named above.

## 3. Lane classification (3.9 is L4b's — see "Moved to L4b")

- [ ] 3.1 Tool-result classification: nothing to delete on `main`; build it at component entry `C:2195` (ahead of
      `H:2546` and `H:2580`) and in `C:2292`'s live arm — cold → 2.5 first; classify `result.RequestID` against
      `PublishedRequestID` (older → ACK; newer → Retry; unknown → Quarantine). Test: write
      `tool_result_recovery_test.go` (absent on `main`).
- [ ] 3.2 Response lane: cold → 2.5 first at `C:1698-1700`'s live arm; the warm superseded-response guard at `H:1253`
      (`CurrentRequest`, process-local and empty after replacement — L2's residual `ST:955-961`) compares against the
      record's `PublishedRequestID`; newer → Retry. Test: write `settlement_recovery_test.go` (response-lane cases).
- [ ] 3.4 Task lane: a cold fork before `C:1396` (`HandleTask`) — read the record by `task.LoopID`; absent → birth;
      present at iteration 0 → rebuild R1 through `buildTaskRequest` (`H:1120`) and republish it unconditionally with
      the MsgId, no retained read (Q1); present and advanced → ACK. Test: `recovery_test.go` (exists, extend) — cold
      redelivery at iteration 0 and after advance.
- [ ] 3.5 Terminal + unproven result (Q7): effect-free ACK with a `WarnContext` audit line; two new reason values on
      the existing `tool_results_dropped_total` (`older_request`, `terminal_unproven`; `M:382-383`, recorder `M:527`,
      existing use `C:2299`) rather than a new counter; the warm check is inserted before `HandleToolResult` at
      `C:2195`, because `H:2546` and `H:2580` precede the lane's only terminal guard at `H:2652`. Test: write
      `terminal_tool_recovery_test.go`; both reason values asserted.
- [ ] 3.8 In-flight answer (the MODIFIED requirement's new SHALL NOT): a test citing that requirement (`// spec:` line;
      `git grep 'acknowledgement floor' -- '*_test.go'` is empty — add it beside the in-flight query) with a case where
      the record names `published_request_id` and a non-empty `pending_tool_results` while the process is gone and the
      answer is still consumer bookkeeping; `git grep -n 'PublishedRequestID\|published_request_id' -- ':!processor/agentic-loop' ':!agentic'`
      returns only docs/spec.
- [ ] 3.10 Component-entry classification for a duplicate terminal tool result (docket OQ5, owner ruling 2026-09-22):
      the check sits at `C:2195`, and `TransitionTo`'s same-state `nil` (`AG:181`) stays untouched — it is a legitimate
      no-op for other callers. Test: a duplicate `StopLoop` result delivered to a loop whose record is `complete`
      publishes nothing and moves no record timestamp (the record is not written at all), in
      `terminal_tool_recovery_test.go`.

## 4. Property and window evidence

- [ ] 4.1 New `processor/agentic-loop/applied_facts_property_test.go`: Rapid state machine over an in-memory KV and a
      fake evidence reader; actions deliver / crash-at-{W1,W2,W3,W4} / redeliver / replace-process on the tool and
      response lanes; checks I1–I4 after every step (I2 as membership, never rendering) and "no duplicate request
      published unless absent from the fake stream". The approval-response lane's three shapes use named examples and
      land with L4b (#1362).
- [ ] 4.2 Real-NATS W2 and W4 on the tool lane — the W4 case RESTARTS the process via `test/e2e/harness/processbarrier`
      (replacement, not a fresh handler) and asserts the adoption-first write — plus W2 and W4 (truncation retry) on the
      response lane; assertions read `AGENT_LOOPS` (`published_request_id`, `iterations`, `state`) and count messages
      per subject, never bodies. Files: new `tool_result_redelivery_integration_test.go`, new
      `identity_adoption_integration_test.go`. The approval-lane reject W4 and the terminal lane's
      crash-after-publish-before-`Update` are L4b's.
- [ ] 4.3 Mutation evidence (`cp` backup + checksum, never stash): (a) restore Put-before-publish in 2.1 → W4 in 4.2
      fails; (b) restore plain `Put` → the CAS case in 2.1 fails; (c) skip adoption in 2.3 → the 4.1 property fails;
      (e) skip step 0 in 2.5 → the restarted W4 case in 4.2 retries to `MaxDeliver`. (d) and (f) are L4b's.

## 5. Docs and spec

- [ ] 5.1 Correct `docs/concepts/17-approval-flow.md:65` and `processor/agentic-loop/doc.go` restart claims to state the
      I1–I4 contract and its prerequisites (#1327–#1329).
- [ ] 5.2 Apply the `specs/agentic-loop/spec.md` delta; `openspec validate agentic-loop-durable-applied-facts --strict`
      green; `task spec:properties` resolves the `// spec:` citation from 4.1 against the ADDED requirement.
- [ ] 5.3 No approval-deadline hydration (docket OQ2, owner ruling 2026-09-22): the delta scenario "a replaced process
      re-arms no approval deadline; the loop stays `awaiting_approval` until answered or cancelled" plus the same
      sentence as a line in `docs/operations/migration-beta162-to-beta163.md` under a `#1330` section. Test: a
      replacement component started over a KV record in `awaiting_approval` arms no deadline (the sweeper's snapshot,
      `AS:69`, is empty) and writes nothing — the record's state and revision are unchanged.
- [ ] 5.4 `tasks_submitted_total` is at-least-once under redelivery (docket OQ4, owner ruling 2026-09-22): one line in
      `docs/operations/migration-beta162-to-beta163.md` under the same `#1330` section; no arm change. Test: a
      dispatch-side unit test asserting a replayed task submission increments the counter again
      (`processor/agentic-dispatch/metrics.go:112`, `recordTaskSubmitted` `:322`), so the documented semantics are
      pinned rather than assumed.

## 6. Verification (before the push, every time)

- [ ] 6.1 `task check:push` (schema drift expected empty — `LoopEntity` is in no schema); `go run ./cmd/entity-id-audit .`
      green.
- [ ] 6.2 `task e2e:agentic` with the process-replacement stage (`stage_a_process_replacement.go`,
      `process_replacement_test.go`) named in the PR body with exit codes; BREAKING for the recovery contract, so this
      tier is the gate (`docs/contributing/02-e2e-tests.md` § Breaking Changes). The approval-after-restart stage is
      L4b's.

## Moved to L4b (#1362)

Plain bullets, deliberately not checkboxes: these are #1362's tasks, listed so the reader sees exactly what left this
change and where it went. Owner ruling 2026-09-22, OQ7; the split line is `reconciliation.md` § G.

- 3.3 Approval lane — the cold KV branch at `ARH:58` on `ErrLoopNotFound` (today `staleDrop` `ARH:78` → Ack
  `ARH:194-199`), I4 plus key presence against the record it just adopted, `republishPendingApproval` built inside it,
  and the warm re-echo at `H:2674`. Tests: `approval_timeout_recovery_test.go`, `approval_restore_order_test.go`.
- OQ1 `continuation_unavailable` — the ruled outcome for confirmed-absent approval evidence (#1146 acceptance line;
  owner ruling 2026-09-13), one branch, built with the approval lane.
- 3.6 Governance verdict after waiter loss (Q6) — `C:2734` → `settleVerdictWithoutWaiter` (`C:2759`) reads the record
  and classifies (Ack older/consumed/terminal with a reason on `M:393`; Retry current-unseen). Test:
  `verdict_wire_test.go`.
- 3.7 One terminal owner — three `Put` paths (`C:1974`, `C:1752` → `:1809` → `:1831`, `C:2631` → `:2668` → `:2683`)
  become marker `Create` (`KV:211`/`KV:218`) → stamps → publish → entity `Update` (`KV:231`), clearing
  `PendingApproval` on the terminal transition (L3's deferred item). Test: `terminal_owner_test.go` (a)/(b)/(c).
- 3.9 Route-ambiguity metering (owner ruling 2026-09-21; docket OQ6) — meter `loop_route_ambiguous` on
  `loop_admission_refusals_total` inside `activeLoop` (`processor/agentic-dispatch/http_activity.go:334`,
  `metrics.go:180`) with one resolver-seam reason value; retire the two post-refusal absence assertions in
  `command_target_resolution_test.go` (`:335`, `:349`), keep the 409 assertion at `:346-348`. Never opened here.
- 4.2 (approval and terminal cases) — the approval-response lane's reject W4 (crash between the carrier's publish and
  its `Update` for the approval result, restart, redeliver → ACK inapplicable, R(N+1) counted once, record `running` at
  R(N+1) with no gate) and the terminal lane's crash-after-publish-before-`Update`, in a new
  `terminal_tool_redelivery_integration_test.go`.
- 4.3 (d) and (f) — restore `Put` for the marker in 3.7 (drop the `Create` read-back) → the terminal case in 4.2 fails;
  drop the gate clear from 2.5 → the approval-lane W4 case in 4.2 fails on I4 and re-runs the rejection.
- 6.2 (approval stage) — the `task e2e:agentic` approval-after-restart stage (`approval_restart.go`,
  `approval_restart_test.go`, both absent on `main`), which asserts the answer is applied after replacement, not that a
  deadline fires.
